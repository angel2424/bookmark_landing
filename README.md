Hello there! Welcome to my project. This project was taken from Front end mentor.

I really enjoyed working on this project because even tough I've done other several projects as a beginner (which are not here in my github), I really felt that I was able to build this more easily, and I now know that I'm really comfortable with JavaScript, more then when I started out. So, I hope you can take some time to look at my live preview and my code! I would love to hear your feedback.

In the next couple of days I'll be adding a few animations using GSAP!

You can see the live preview here! (https://angel2424.github.io/bookmark_landing)
